TCP-Socket-Thread-Pool-Java-example
===================================

An example of how to make a server with a thread pool (manually not with Executors) In JAVA using TCP Sockets

##What is this?

It is a little example that consists in a client that request to a server a word. The Server will respond with the definition of that word.

It is very simple.


##Implementation

All is implemented in Java.

It uses an old version of RitaWordnet [Link](http://www.rednoise.org/rita/download/index.html)

The server is implemented using a thread Pool but that thread Pool is implemented manually not using the easy way that is Executors. It is only for showing how to do this.

Server and client comunicates via TCP sockets.

All is done using Eclipse so you can import as 2 projects one is the client and one the server.

You can use the code in the way that you want.

Any recomendation just send me an email [here](perseus086@gmail.com)
